# User Authentication & Database Models - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the user authentication system and database models for Wayra's travel planning platform. This foundational system will enable user registration, secure authentication, trip persistence, and user profile management - all essential for the collaborative travel planning experience.

The system will integrate Firebase Authentication for secure user management while implementing MongoDB models for data persistence. This foundation supports Wayra's core vision of collaborative, AI-powered travel planning with budget optimization focus.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Registration & Authentication

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account and securely log in to Wayra so that I can save my travel plans and collaborate with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL provide options to register with email/password, Google, or other social providers
2. WHEN a user registers with valid information THEN the system SHALL create a Firebase user account and corresponding database profile
3. WHEN a user attempts to register with invalid information THEN the system SHALL display clear validation errors
4. WHEN a registered user logs in with correct credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to the dashboard
5. WHEN a user logs in with incorrect credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
6. WHEN an authenticated user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL maintain their session without requiring re-login
7. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to the login page

### Requirement 2: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to manage my profile information and travel preferences so that the AI can provide personalized recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display their current information (name, email, preferences)
2. WHEN a user updates their profile information THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes to the database
3. WHEN a user sets travel preferences THEN the system SHALL store these for AI personalization
4. WHEN a user uploads a profile picture THEN the system SHALL store it securely and display it in the interface
5. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL update it securely through Firebase
6. WHEN a user deletes their account THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data while preserving shared trip data

### Requirement 3: Trip Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my AI-generated travel plans to be automatically saved so that I can access them later and continue planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates a travel plan THEN the system SHALL automatically save it to the user's account
2. WHEN a user views their trip history THEN the system SHALL display all their saved trips with key details
3. WHEN a user opens a saved trip THEN the system SHALL load all trip data including itinerary, budget, and preferences
4. WHEN a user modifies a saved trip THEN the system SHALL update the database with versioning support
5. WHEN a user deletes a trip THEN the system SHALL remove it from their account but preserve shared group data
6. WHEN a user searches their trips THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by destination, date, budget, and status

### Requirement 4: Group Travel Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to invite friends to collaborate on trip planning so that we can plan group travel together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a group trip THEN the system SHALL allow them to invite others by email
2. WHEN a user receives a trip invitation THEN the system SHALL notify them and allow them to accept/decline
3. WHEN multiple users collaborate on a trip THEN the system SHALL track individual contributions and permissions
4. WHEN a group member makes changes THEN the system SHALL notify other members and track the change history
5. WHEN a user leaves a group trip THEN the system SHALL remove their access while preserving their contributions
6. WHEN the trip owner transfers ownership THEN the system SHALL update permissions accordingly

### Requirement 5: Data Security & Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal information and travel plans to be secure and private so that I can trust Wayra with my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information at rest
2. WHEN user data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS and secure protocols
3. WHEN a user sets privacy preferences THEN the system SHALL respect their choices for data sharing
4. WHEN accessing user data THEN the system SHALL implement proper authorization checks
5. WHEN a security incident occurs THEN the system SHALL have audit logs for investigation
6. WHEN a user requests their data THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality
7. WHEN required by law THEN the system SHALL support data deletion and compliance requirements

### Requirement 6: AI Integration & Personalization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to learn from my preferences and past trips so that it provides increasingly personalized recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a trip THEN the system SHALL store feedback and preferences for AI learning
2. WHEN the AI generates recommendations THEN the system SHALL consider the user's historical preferences
3. WHEN a user rates AI suggestions THEN the system SHALL store this feedback for improvement
4. WHEN a user has travel patterns THEN the system SHALL identify and suggest similar experiences
5. WHEN a user collaborates frequently with others THEN the system SHALL learn group preferences
6. WHEN generating budget recommendations THEN the system SHALL consider the user's spending patterns

### Requirement 7: Performance & Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to respond quickly and reliably even as more people use Wayra.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs authentication THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user loads their trip data THEN the system SHALL display it within 3 seconds
3. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain performance
4. WHEN the database grows large THEN the system SHALL implement efficient indexing and queries
5. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL scale horizontally without data loss
6. WHEN a database operation fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and error handling

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing AI System

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication and profile to seamlessly work with the AI planning system so that I get personalized travel recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the AI system SHALL have access to their preferences and history
2. WHEN the AI generates a plan THEN the system SHALL associate it with the authenticated user
3. WHEN a user has budget preferences THEN the AI SHALL prioritize recommendations within their range
4. WHEN a user has travel history THEN the AI SHALL avoid duplicate suggestions unless requested
5. WHEN a user collaborates in groups THEN the AI SHALL consider all group members' preferences
6. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL maintain user context across AI interactions
