# 🧅 WAYRA AI INTEGRATION: FUNCTIONAL "PEELING THE ONION" STRATEGY

## 📋 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This document outlines a strategic approach to integrating AI capabilities from three repositories into Wayra, organized by functional layers rather than individual files. This "peeling the onion" approach ensures that each integration phase delivers complete, working functionality while maintaining alignment with Wayra's existing architecture.

## 🎯 **CORE PRINCIPLES**

1. **Functional Completeness**: Each integration layer delivers complete, working functionality
2. **Inside-Out Approach**: Start with core capabilities and expand outward
3. **Immediate Value**: Each layer provides immediate value to users
4. **Minimal Disruption**: Preserve existing functionality while adding new capabilities
5. **Maximum Reuse**: Directly incorporate existing code with minimal modifications
