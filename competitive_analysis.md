## Market Gaps and Opportunities

### Budget-First Trip Planning Gap
Current solutions focus on individual flight or hotel bookings rather than comprehensive trip budgeting. No existing platform allows users to set a total trip budget and receive intelligent recommendations for optimizing spending across all travel components.

### Proactive vs Reactive Monitoring
Most existing solutions are reactive, notifying users when prices change. There's an opportunity for proactive monitoring that continuously searches for prices that meet user-defined budget targets.

### Automated Booking Workflow Gap
While some platforms offer price protection after booking, none provide automated booking when price targets are met. This represents a significant opportunity for differentiation.

### Collaborative Budget Intelligence
Existing solutions focus on individual travelers. There's an opportunity for collaborative trip planning with shared budget monitoring and group decision-making features.

### Historical Price Intelligence for Users
While companies like Hopper use historical data for predictions, they don't expose detailed historical price trends to users for informed decision-making.
